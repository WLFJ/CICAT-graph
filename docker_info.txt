*** Instructions for using docker ***

From the cicat-master directory:

   Building the docker image:
   
      docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t cicat .
      
   Running the docker image:
   
      docker run -it --mount src=$(pwd)/shared,target=/home/cicat/shared,type=bind cicat   
          Note: --mount connects a location on the host to a set location in the docker image, which allows you to share files between the host and the docker image. 
      
      From a terminal window:
        
        python cicat/generator/scenGEN.py >> shared/scenGEN_result.txt   
            Note: This command runs the scenGEN.py utility and sends output to a file stored at the shared location.
        
        exit
