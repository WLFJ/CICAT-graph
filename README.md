# Critical Infrastructure Cyberspace Analysis Tool (CICAT) v1.1
# CICAT is a modeling and simulation tool for evaluating how an adversary might conduct a cyber attack. CICAT uses a threat model that leverages open source cyber threat data provided by MITRE Enterprise ATT&CKâ„¢ and ATT&CK for ICS. MITRE developed CICAT to automate production of cyber attack scenarios in support of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Coordinated Research Program (CRP) J02008: "Enhancing Computer Security Incident Analysis at Nuclear Facilities", which seeks to improve capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber security incidents at nuclear facilities. 
# A whitepaper discussing CICAT functional capabilities is available at https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/critical-infrastructure-cyberspace-analysis-tool-cicat-capability.
