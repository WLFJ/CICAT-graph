# Critical Infrastructure Cyberspace Analysis Tool (CICAT)
CICAT is a modeling and simulation tool for evaluating how an adversary might conduct a cyber attack. CICAT uses a threat model that leverages open source cyber threat data provided by MITRE Enterprise ATT&CKâ„¢ and ATT&CK for ICS. MITRE developed CICAT to automate production of cyber attack scenarios in support of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Coordinated Research Program (CRP) J02008: "Enhancing Computer Security Incident Analysis at Nuclear Facilities", which seeks to improve capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber security incidents at nuclear facilities.

# How to run
In the CICAT v1.1 distribution, the python program scenGEN.py is used to generate cyber attack scenarios. This program imports an infrastructure model and scenario specification as Excel spreadsheets, and exports generated scnerarios data as an Excel spreadsdheet. 
To run scenGEN.py\: 
python scenGEN.py -i \<infrastucture spreadsheet.xlsx\> -s \<scenario specification.xlsx\> -o \<results spreadsheet.xlsx\>
                                                                                                   
                                                                                              


Examples of the imported spreadsheet data are available in the data subdirectory.
